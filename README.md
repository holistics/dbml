# DBML - Database Markup Language

DBML (database markup language) is a simple, readable DSL language designed to define database structures.

## Benefits

- It is simple, flexible and highly human-readable
- It is database agnostic, focusing on the essential database structure definition without worrying about the detailed syntaxes of each database
- Comes with a free, simple database visualiser at [dbdiagram.io](http://dbdiagram.io)

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)
**(coming soon)** A `dbml-to-sql` generator to generate SQL from `.dbml` file
- Allow users to integrate DBML with their workflow
- Each project will have one or several `.dbml` files to define database schema
- DBML-CLI will be used to export `.dbml` files to specific SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc), JSON format, etc
- DBML-CLI could also be used to generate `.dbml` files from other SQL or JSON files

## Example

Example of a database definition of a simple blogging site:

    Table users {
        id integer
        username varchar
        role varchar
        created_at timestamp
    }

    Table posts {
        id integer [primary key]
        title varchar
        body text [note: 'Content of the post']
        user_id integer
        created_at timestamp
    }

    Ref: posts.user_id > users.id // many-to-one

## Is this similar to SQL DDL?

Not quite. Despite its name (data "definition" language), DDL is designed mainly to help physically create, modify or remove tables, not to define them.

**DDL also comes with a few more drawbacks:**

- It is hard to read, especially when trying to add multiple column/table settings together.
- It is database specific (Oracle vs PostgreSQL vs MySQL, etc)
- Since it is imperative (vs declarative), to fully reconstruct a table definition you have to trace through all the code (instead of focusing on just 1 single section).

## How to generate SQL from DBML?

1. Go to dbdiagram.io
2. Type up your DBML code
3. Go to Export > SQL (choose your DB)

### Table Definition
    
    Table table_name {
        column_name column_type [column_settings]
    }
    
- title of database table is listed as `table_name`
- name of the column is listed as `column_name`
- type of the data in the column listed as `column_type`
    - supports all data types, as long as it is a single word (remove all spaces in the data type). Example, JSON, JSONB, decimal(1,2), etc.
- list is wrapped in `curly brackets {}`, for indexes, constraints and table definitions
- settings are wrapped in `square brackets []`
- string value is to be wrapped in a `single quote as 'string'`
- `column_name` can be stated in just plain text, or wrapped in a `double quote as "column name"`
    
**Table Alias:** 
You can alias the table, and use them in the references later on.

    Table very_long_user_table as U {
        ...
    }
    
    Ref: U.id < posts.user_id
    
**Table Notes (coming soon):** 
You can add notes to the table, and refer to them in the visual plane.
    
    Table users {
        id integer
        status varchar [note: 'status']
	
        [note: 'Contains all users information']
    }

**Table Settings:** 
Settings are all defined within square brackets: `[setting1: value1, setting2: value2, setting3, setting4]`

Each setting item can take in 2 forms: `Key: Value` or `keyword`, similar to that of Python function parameters.

- `color: <color_code>`: change the table header color (coming soon)

    Example, `[color: #3498db]`

### Column Definition

**Column Settings:** 
Each column can take have optinal settings, defined in square brackets like:

    Table buildings {
        ...
        address varchar(255) [unique, not null, note: 'to include unit number']
        id integer [ pk, unique, default: 123, note: 'Number' ]
    }

The list of column settings you can use:

- `note: 'string to add notes'`: add a metadata note to this column
- `primary key` or `pk`: mark a column as primary key. For composite primary key, refer to the 'Indexes' section
- `null` or `not null`: mark a column null or not null
- `unique`: mark the column unique
- `default: some_value`: set a default value of the column, please refer to the 'Default Value' section below (NEW)
- `increment`: mark the column as auto-increment (NEW)

**Default Value (NEW):** 
You can set default value as:

- number value starts blank: `default: 123` or `default: 123.456`
- string value starts with single quotes: `default: 'some string value'`
- expression value is wrapped with parenthesis: ``default: `now() - interval '5 days'` ``
- boolean (true/false/null): `default: false` or `default: null`

Example,

    Table users {
        id integer [primary key]
        username varchar(255) [not null, unique]
        full_name varchar(255) [not null]
        gender varchar(1) [default: 'm']
        created_at timestamp [default: `now()`]
        rating integer [default: 10]
    }

**Index Definition (NEW):** 
Indexes allow users to quickly locate and access the data. Users can define single or multi-column indexes. 

    Table bookings {
      id integer [primary key]
      country varchar
      booking_date date
      created_at timestamp

      indexes {
          created_at [name: 'Date']
          booking_date
          (country, booking_date) [unique]
          booking_date [type: hash]
          (`id*2`)
          (`id*3`,`getdate()`)
          (`id*3`,id)
      }
    }
    
There are 3 types of index definitions:

- Index with single field (with index name): `CREATE INDEX on users (created_at)`
- Index with multiple fields (composite index): `CREATE INDEX on users (created_at, country)`
- Index with an expression: `CREATE INDEX ON films ( first_name + last_name )`
- (bonus) Composite index with expression: `CREATE INDEX ON users ( country, (lower(name)) )`

Index Settings

- `type`: type of index (btree, gin, gist, hash depending on DB). For now, only type btree and hash are accepted.
- `name`: name of index
- `unique`: unique index

### Relationships & Foreign Key Definitions
Relationships are used to define foreign key constraints between tables.

    Table posts {
        id integer [primary key]
        user_id integer [ref: > users.id] // many-to-one
    }

    // or this
    Table users {
        id integer [ref: < posts.user_id, ref: < reviews.user_id] // one to many
    }

    // The space after '<' is optional
    
There are 3 types of relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one

- `<`: one-to-many. E.g: `users.id < posts.user_id`
- `>`: many-to-one. E.g: `posts.user_id > users.id`
- `-`: one-to-one. E.g: `users.id - user_infos.user_id`

In DBML, there are 3 syntaxes to define relationships:

    //Long form
    Ref name_optional {
      table1.column1 < table2.column2
    }

    //Short form:
    Ref name_optional: table1.column1 < table2.column2
    
    // Inline form
    Table posts {
        id integer
        user_id integer [ref: > users.id]
    }
    
**Many-to-many relationship**

For many-to-many relationship, we don't have a syntax for it as we believe it should be represented as 2 many-to-one relationships. For more information, please refer to https://www.holistics.io/blog/dbdiagram-io-many-to-many-relationship-diagram-generator-script/

### Comments
You can comment in your code using `//`, so it is easier for you to review the code later.

Example,

    // order_items refer to items from that order
    
### Metadata Column Notes
You can add notes to your columns, so you can easily refer to it when hovering over the column in the diagram canvas.

    column_name column_type [note: 'replace text here']
Example,

    Table orders {
        status varchar [
        note: '
        üí∏ 1 = processing, 
        ‚úîÔ∏è 2 = shipped, 
        ‚ùå 3 = cancelled,
        üòî 4 = refunded
        ']
    }

### Enum Definition
`Enum` allows users to define different values of a particular column.
When hovering over the column in the canvas, the enum values will be displayed.

    enum job_status {
        created [note: 'Waiting to be processed']
        running
        done
        failure
    }

    Table jobs {
        id integer
        status job_status
    }

### TableGroup (coming soon)
`TableGroup` allows users to group the related or associated tables together.

    TableGroup tablegroup_name { // tablegroup is case-insensitive.
        table1 
        table2 
        table3
    }

    //example
    TableGroup e-commerce1 {
        merchants
        countries
    }

### Syntax Consistency
DBML is the standard language for database and the syntax is consistent to provide clear and extensive functions.

- curly brackets `{}`: grouping for indexes, constraints and table definitions
- square brackets `[]`: settings
- forward slashes `//`: comments
- `column_name` is stated in just plain text
- single quote as `'string'`: string value
- double quote as `"column name"`: quoting variable
- backtick `` ` ``: function expression
